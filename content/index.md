<div style="font-size: 1.15rem;">
    <p>Hello World! I am Lalith B Seervi, an aspiring web developer from Bengaluru, India.</p><p>I grew up around computers <i>(youngest sibling privileges, hehe)</i> and was mostly fond of video games. 2020 was around the first time I started to seriously explore the field of Computer Science.</p> 
    <p>One thing that has stuck with me from since then is the awe for the countless <a href="./concepts/abstraction">abstractions</a> that we have, and in particular, the ones behind how computers communicate with each other. There's so much at play and yet the typical end-user need not understand any of it!</p>
