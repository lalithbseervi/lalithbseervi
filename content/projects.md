Coming from my hobby to write, I thought of taking on the challenge of creating my very own version of Google Docs. While it may not be nearly as fancy as I hoped it would be, I think it still has a substance of its own. Using the tinyMCE rich-text-editor, I was able to write posts. Later, I used some basic logic to categorize posts and search them.

## [Matrix Solver](./matrix/)
HTML5, CSS3, Javascript

During my studied in 2024, my class was asked if it could build a program to solve for inverse of a matrix. I built a C++ program and, although it worked, I wanted to be able to do a live demo instead of directly show the output's screenshot. 

Just like that, I got to work on building the same program in Javascript, and thus the Matrix Solver was born.
